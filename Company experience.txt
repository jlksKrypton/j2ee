 Hi this is Suhas,
 Thank you so much for your time i appreciate that
 
recently worked as java developer with Goldman Sachs in New York

I have been working in this field from 8 Years.

My responsibility includes design and development of web applications by using technologies like Core Java J2EE,
Spring, spring boot Frameworks,using variousDesign Patterns.

to handle the requests and deliver responses to clients I developed rest end points  for the web application

in order to persist this data in SQl i used the frame work called Hibernate for object relation mapping and 

used jUnit assertJ for unit testing before deploying them in servlet cotainer like Apache Tomcat in local machine or in servers like WebSphere.

I used filters and spring security module's for securing our applications.

and to trace the process to know what's happening when it's actually running i worked with tools like logback log4j with sl4j to provide more flexibility in future

coming to front end I worked with JavaScript , Angular JS, HTML, CSS to integrate with the backend we developed before.
 
and in my projects i worked with jenkins for continuous integration while committing to local or git repositories

and I worked with swagger swagger2markup api's for documention.
 
in all these years i worked in various domains like banking, insurance  

I have worked for some of the clients like Citi Bank, Anthem, ING  Banks.  

Overall I can say that I have a good knowledge in Web application development.

My strength is more on back end when compared to frontend


I think that's pretty much i can say about my skills and experience

Is there anything else you want to know
